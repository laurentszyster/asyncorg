Asyncorg started as an enhanced port to Java 1.5 of Pythonâ€™s [asyncore.py](http://docs.python.org/lib/module-asyncore.html) and [asynchat.py](http://docs.python.org/lib/module-asynchat.html) standard modules, with support for [netstrings](http://cr.yp.to/proto/netstrings.txt) protocols.

It is growing into a Java library for high performance network peer that is as practical as [Medusa](http://www.nightmare.com/medusa/), with support for the basic stack of web 2.0 protocols: DNS, MIME, HTTP/1.1, XML/1.0, JSON and Javascript.

Refreshly small, functional and dynamic for the Java world, asyncorg provides a framework that depends on a few de-facto cross-plateform standards: Rhino, XP and SQLite.
